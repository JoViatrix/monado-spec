# Monado

Monado is an open source XR runtime delivering immersive experiences such as VR and AR on on mobile, PC/desktop, and any other device (because gosh darn people come up with a lot of weird hardware).

Monado aims to be a complete and conforming implementation of the OpenXR API made by Khronos.

The project currently is being developed for GNU/Linux and aims to support other operating systems in the near future. "Monado" has no specific meaning and is just a name.
